# Collecta-Client

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.8.

## How to run for development
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Make sure you have Angular CLI installed
    ```bash
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```
3. Navigate to the project directory
    ```bash
    cd collecta-client
    ```
4. Run a development server (will open on the default port, `http://localhost:4200`)
    ```bash
    ng serve --open
    ```
### Notes:
  - The development server has all the api calls proxied to the server (see `/src/proxy.conf.json`), so server must be running too
